```

After 36 occurrences, this recurring expense will stop appearing in projections.

Amount: ₹3,000
Frequency: Monthly
Remaining Recurrences: 6
```

## Managing Recurring Transactions

### Viewing All Recurring Items

Each recurring type has its own list:
- View all recurring incomes
- View all recurring expenses
- View all recurring transfers

### Editing Recurring Transactions

Update when things change:

**Amount Change:**
- Salary increase → Update recurring income amount
- Rent hike → Update recurring expense amount
- EMI change → Update accordingly

**Account Change:**
- New bank account → Update the account field

**Frequency Change:**
- Service changed billing cycle → Update frequency

### Deleting Recurring Transactions

Remove when:
- You cancel a subscription
- A loan is paid off
- Service is discontinued
- You stop a regular contribution

### Pausing vs Deleting

If something is temporarily stopped:
- You can delete and recreate later
- Or set remaining recurrences to 0 temporarily
- Or remove the account (set to "No account") to skip transactions while keeping the schedule

### Using No Account (Skip Transaction)

For recurring incomes and expenses, you can leave the account empty:

**When to use "No account":**
- You haven't decided which account to use yet
- You want to track a reminder without creating transactions
- You're planning future expenses but not ready to commit to an account

**What happens:**
- No income/expense entry is created
- The next transaction date still advances
- Remaining recurrences still decrement
- The recurring item stays active for projections planning

### Using No Accounts for Transfers (Skip Transaction)

For recurring transfers, you can leave both the source and destination accounts empty:

**When to use "No accounts":**
- You're planning a future recurring transfer but haven't decided the accounts yet
- You want to track a reminder without creating actual transfer entries
- You're planning internal money movements but not ready to commit

**What happens:**
- No transfer entry is created
- The next transaction date still advances
- Remaining recurrences still decrement
- The recurring transfer stays active

**Note**: Either both accounts must be set, or both must be empty. You cannot set just one account.

## Tips for Effective Recurring Management

### Be Comprehensive

Add ALL regular items:
- Even small subscriptions
- Annual payments (insurance, subscriptions)
- Irregular but regular items (quarterly insurance)

### Use Accurate Dates

Match actual payment dates:
- Check when your salary actually hits
- Verify bill due dates
- Use the date money moves, not due date

### Review Monthly

Each month, check:
- Are amounts still correct?
- Any new subscriptions to add?
- Any cancelled services to remove?
- Are dates accurate?

### Use Tags Consistently

Tag recurring items like regular transactions:
- Helps with filtering and analysis
- Shows recurring items in category totals

## Recurring Transactions and Projections

### How They Power Projections

Your recurring transactions determine projected balances:
1. System starts with current balance
2. Adds expected recurring incomes
3. Subtracts expected recurring expenses
4. Applies expected transfers
5. Shows day-by-day projected balance

### Improving Projection Accuracy

For better projections:
- Set up ALL recurring items
- Keep amounts current
- Use accurate dates
- Review and update regularly

### What Projections Show

With proper recurring setup, projections show:
- When bills will hit your account
- Expected balance after salary
- Cash flow timing
- Future financial position

## Troubleshooting

### Projection Seems Wrong

Check:
- Are all recurring items set up?
- Are amounts correct?
- Are dates accurate?
- Is the frequency right?

### Missed Regular Payment

If a recurring item didn't appear:
- Check if it's still active
- Verify the next transaction date
- Ensure it wasn't accidentally deleted

### Duplicate Entries in Projections

If seeing duplicates:
- Check for duplicate recurring entries
- Verify you don't have both one-time and recurring for same item
