# Analyzing Spending Patterns

This guide shows you how to use Arthalekha's filtering, tagging, and export features to understand your spending patterns and make informed financial decisions.

## Why Analyze Spending?

Understanding where your money goes helps you:
- Identify areas of overspending
- Find opportunities to save
- Make informed budget decisions
- Track progress toward goals
- Spot unusual expenses

## Using Tags for Analysis

### Set Up Analysis-Friendly Tags

Create tags that enable meaningful analysis:

**By Category:**
```
Food, Transport, Bills, Shopping, Entertainment, Health, Education
```

**By Necessity:**
```
Essential, Important, Optional, Luxury
```

**By Frequency:**
```
Daily, Weekly, Monthly, One-time
```

### Tag Everything

For analysis to work, tag all transactions:
- Apply at least one category tag
- Add additional tags for more insight
- Be consistent with tagging

## Basic Analysis Techniques

### Technique 1: Category Spending

See how much you spend per category:

1. Go to Expenses
2. Filter by tag: "Food"
3. Set date range: This month
4. View total food expenses

Repeat for each category to build a spending breakdown.

### Technique 2: Month-over-Month Comparison

Compare spending across months:

1. Filter by tag: "Food"
2. Set date range: January
3. Note the total
4. Change date range: February
5. Compare totals

### Technique 3: Person Analysis

See individual spending:

1. Filter by person: "Arjun"
2. Set date range: This month
3. View all their expenses
4. Add tag filter for specific categories

### Technique 4: Account Analysis

See where money goes from each account:

1. Filter by account: "Credit Card"
2. Set date range as needed
3. See all credit card expenses

## Deep Dive Analysis

### Finding Your Top Expenses

Steps to find biggest spending areas:

1. Export all expenses for the period
2. Open in spreadsheet software
3. Sort by amount (highest first)
4. Review top 10-20 expenses
5. Look for patterns

### Tracking Subscriptions

Find all your subscriptions:

1. Create a "Subscription" tag
2. Tag all subscription expenses
3. Filter by "Subscription" tag
4. Export and review
5. Total your monthly subscription costs

### Identifying Impulse Spending

Look for unplanned purchases:

1. Review expenses without "Essential" tag
2. Sort by date to see patterns
3. Note emotional or impulse purchases
4. Calculate monthly impulse spending

## Monthly Analysis Routine

### Week 1: Quick Check

At month start:
- Review previous month's total spending
- Compare to income
- Note major expenses

### Week 2: Category Review

Mid-month:
- Check each major category
- See if on track with typical spending
- Identify any unusual spikes

### Week 3: Trend Analysis

Later in month:
- Compare to previous months
- Look for increasing trends
- Celebrate decreasing trends

### Week 4: Detailed Analysis

Month end:
- Full category breakdown
- Export for detailed review
- Set goals for next month

## Using Exports for Advanced Analysis

### Export Process

1. Filter to the data you want
2. Click Export/Download CSV
3. Open in Excel or Google Sheets
4. Analyze with spreadsheet tools

### Spreadsheet Analysis Ideas

**Pivot Table by Category:**
```
Rows: Tag/Category
Values: Sum of Amount
Result: Total per category
```

**Monthly Trend Chart:**
```
Rows: Month
Columns: Categories
Values: Sum of Amount
Result: Category spending over time
```

**Daily Average:**
```
Total expenses ÷ Days in month = Daily average spending
```

## Key Metrics to Track

### Essential Metrics

| Metric | How to Calculate |
|--------|------------------|
| **Savings Rate** | (Income - Expenses) ÷ Income × 100 |
| **Essential %** | Essential Expenses ÷ Total Expenses × 100 |
| **Food %** | Food Expenses ÷ Total Expenses × 100 |
| **Fixed Expenses** | Sum of Rent + Bills + EMIs |

### Target Benchmarks

General guidelines (adjust for your situation):

| Category | Suggested % of Income |
|----------|----------------------|
| Housing (Rent/EMI) | 25-30% |
| Food | 10-15% |
| Transportation | 10-15% |
| Savings | 20%+ |
| Everything else | 30-35% |

## Identifying Problems

### Red Flags to Watch For

**Spending > Income:**
- Total expenses exceed total income
- Dipping into savings monthly
- Increasing credit card balance

**Category Creep:**
- A category steadily increasing month over month
- Small increases that add up

**Subscription Overload:**
- Total subscriptions > 10% of income
- Services you don't use
- Forgotten subscriptions

### Investigation Steps

When you spot a problem:

1. **Identify**: Which category is the issue?
2. **Drill Down**: Filter to see specific transactions
3. **Analyze**: Look for patterns or specific causes
4. **Plan**: Decide on action steps
5. **Track**: Monitor the change next month

## Setting and Tracking Goals

### Goal Types

**Reduction Goals:**
- "Reduce food spending by 10%"
- "Cut subscriptions to under ₹2,000"
- "No impulse purchases over ₹1,000"

**Savings Goals:**
- "Save ₹20,000 monthly"
- "Build emergency fund to ₹3,00,000"
- "Save for vacation: ₹50,000 by December"

### Tracking Progress

Monthly progress check:

1. Filter relevant expenses
2. Compare to goal
3. Calculate progress percentage
4. Adjust approach if needed

## Practical Analysis Examples

### Example 1: "Where Does My Money Go?"

**Question:** What am I spending money on?

**Analysis:**
1. Export all expenses for the month
2. Create pivot table by tag/category
3. Sort by amount (highest first)
4. Create pie chart for visualization

**Result:** Clear breakdown of spending by category

### Example 2: "Am I Spending Too Much on Food?"

**Question:** Is my food spending reasonable?

**Analysis:**
1. Filter expenses by "Food" tag
2. Get total for the month
3. Compare to income (should be ~10-15%)
4. Break down: Groceries vs Restaurants

**Result:** Clear view of food spending with sub-categories

### Example 3: "How Much Do I Spend Daily?"

**Question:** What's my daily burn rate?

**Analysis:**
1. Get total expenses for month
2. Divide by days in month
3. Compare to daily income
4. Identify high-spending days

**Result:** Daily average helps budget day-to-day

### Example 4: "Are My Expenses Growing?"

**Question:** Is my spending increasing over time?

**Analysis:**
1. Export 6-12 months of expenses
2. Calculate monthly totals
3. Plot on chart
4. Look for upward trend

**Result:** Trend line shows if spending is growing
