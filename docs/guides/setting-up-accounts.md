# Setting Up Accounts

This guide walks you through setting up your accounts in Arthalekha. Proper account setup is the foundation for accurate financial tracking.

## Before You Start

Gather this information for each account you want to track:
- Account name and type
- Account number (optional, for identification)
- Current balance
- The date from which you want to start tracking

## Step 1: Plan Your Accounts

List all the financial accounts you want to track:

### Essential Accounts

| Account | Type | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Primary bank account | Savings | "HDFC Salary Account" |
| Cash/Wallet | Cash | "Cash Wallet" |
| Credit cards | Credit Card | "HDFC Credit Card" |

### Additional Accounts

| Account | Type | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Savings accounts | Savings | "Emergency Fund" |
| Digital wallets | Wallet | "Google Pay", "Paytm" |
| Investment accounts | Investment | "Mutual Fund SIP" |
| Loans | Loan | "Car Loan" |

## Step 2: Create Your First Account

Let's start with your primary bank account:

### Navigate to Accounts
1. Click on "Accounts" in the navigation menu
2. Click "Add Account" or "Create Account"

### Fill in Account Details

**Name:** Choose a descriptive name
- Good: "HDFC Salary Account"
- Good: "SBI Savings - 4523"
- Avoid: "Bank Account" (too generic)

**Account Type:** Select "Savings" for a bank account

**Identifier (Optional):** Add the last 4 digits of your account number
- Helps identify accounts, especially if you have multiple at the same bank

**Initial Date:** The date from which you'll start tracking
- Tip: Use the 1st of the current month for simplicity
- Or use today's date

**Initial Balance:** The actual balance on the initial date
- Check your bank statement or app for the exact amount
- Enter the precise figure (e.g., ₹52,347.50, not ₹52,000)

### Save the Account

Click "Create" or "Save" to create the account.

## Step 3: Set Up Cash Account

Track physical cash in your wallet:

**Name:** "Cash Wallet" or "Cash"
**Type:** Cash
**Initial Date:** Today
**Initial Balance:** Count your cash and enter the exact amount

## Step 4: Set Up Credit Card

If you use credit cards:

**Name:** "HDFC Credit Card" (include card name for identification)
**Type:** Credit Card
**Identifier:** Last 4 digits of card number
**Initial Date:** Today or statement date
**Initial Balance:** Enter as a **negative number** if you have outstanding debt
- Example: If you owe ₹15,000, enter -15000
- If fully paid, enter 0

## Step 5: Set Up Digital Wallets

For each digital wallet or payment app:

**Name:** "Google Pay", "Paytm", etc.
**Type:** Wallet
**Initial Balance:** Check the app for your current balance

## Step 6: Set Up Investment Accounts (Optional)

For investment tracking:

**Name:** "Mutual Fund SIP", "Zerodha Stocks", etc.
**Type:** Investment
**Initial Balance:** Total amount invested (not current market value)

:::note
Arthalekha tracks cash flow, not market valuations. Your investment account balance represents money you've put in, not current market worth.
:::

## Step 7: Set Up Loan Accounts (Optional)

For loans you've taken:

**Name:** "Car Loan - HDFC"
**Type:** Loan
**Initial Balance:** Enter as **negative** (the amount you owe)
- Example: For a ₹5 lakh loan, enter -500000

For money you've lent to others:

**Name:** "Loan to Rahul"
**Type:** Loan
**Initial Balance:** Enter as **positive** (the amount owed to you)

## Tips for Success

### Start Simple

Don't try to track everything at once:
1. Start with your main accounts (bank, cash, credit card)
2. Add more accounts as you get comfortable
3. You can always add accounts later

### Be Precise with Balances

Accurate initial balances are crucial:
- Check actual balances on the initial date
- Don't round numbers significantly
- This ensures all future calculations are correct

### Use Consistent Naming

Develop a naming convention:
- Include bank/service name: "HDFC Savings"
- Add identifiers for multiples: "SBI Savings - 4523"
- Be descriptive: "Emergency Fund" vs "Savings 2"

### Consider Your Reporting Needs

Think about what you want to track:
- If you want to know cash spending, create a Cash account
- If you want to track investment growth, create Investment accounts
- If you want to monitor debt, create Loan accounts

## What's Next?

After setting up accounts:

1. [Set up People](/docs/guides/family-budgeting) (if tracking by family member)
2. [Create Tags](/docs/concepts/tags) for categorization
3. [Start recording transactions](/docs/guides/tracking-daily-expenses)
4. [Set up recurring transactions](/docs/guides/managing-recurring)

## Troubleshooting

### Balance Doesn't Match Reality

If your Arthalekha balance doesn't match your actual balance:
1. Check the initial balance was entered correctly
2. Verify all transactions have been recorded
3. Look for duplicate or missing transactions
4. Adjust with a correction transaction if needed

### Not Sure Which Type to Choose

When in doubt:
- Bank accounts → Savings
- Credit/debt instruments → Credit Card or Loan
- Digital payment apps → Wallet
- Everything else → Other

### Too Many Accounts?

If you have many accounts:
- Start with the most important ones
- Add others gradually
- Consider if some can be combined (multiple cash locations as one "Cash" account)

### Accidentally Deleted an Account?

Don't worry! Arthalekha uses soft deletes for accounts:
1. Go to the Accounts page
2. Change the **Status** filter to "All (Including Deleted)" or "Deleted Only"
3. Find your deleted account
4. Click **Restore** to bring it back

All your transaction history will be preserved.
