# Tracking Daily Expenses

This guide covers best practices for recording your daily transactions in Arthalekha. Consistent tracking is key to understanding your finances.

## The Recording Habit

### When to Record

The best time to record a transaction is **immediately after it happens**:
- Just paid for coffee? Record it now
- Received a payment? Log it right away
- Made a transfer? Enter it immediately

### Why Immediate Recording Works

- You remember all the details
- Nothing gets forgotten
- Your balance stays accurate
- Less work piling up

### Alternative: Daily Recording Session

If immediate recording isn't practical:
1. Keep receipts or mental notes during the day
2. Set a daily time (evening works well)
3. Record all transactions at once
4. Check bank app for any missed items

## Recording Expenses

### Step-by-Step

1. Navigate to Expenses
2. Click "Add Expense" or "Record Expense"
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Description**: What you bought
   - **Amount**: How much you spent
   - **Date/Time**: When it happened
   - **Account**: Which account/card you used
   - **Person**: Who made the purchase (optional)
   - **Tags**: Categories (optional)
4. Save the expense

### Writing Good Descriptions

**Be specific:**
- Good: "Grocery - Big Bazaar"
- Better: "Weekly Groceries - Big Bazaar"
- Avoid: "Shopping"

**Include relevant details:**
- Good: "Uber - Home to Office"
- Good: "Dinner - Pizza Hut with friends"
- Good: "Amazon - Phone charger"

### Choosing the Right Account

Select the account the money came FROM:
- Paid with debit card → Bank account
- Paid with credit card → Credit card account
- Paid with cash → Cash account
- Paid with UPI → Usually bank account or wallet

## Recording Income

### Step-by-Step

1. Navigate to Incomes
2. Click "Add Income" or "Record Income"
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Description**: Source of income
   - **Amount**: How much received
   - **Date/Time**: When received
   - **Account**: Where the money went
   - **Person**: Who earned it (optional)
   - **Tags**: Categories (optional)
4. Save the income

### Common Income Types

| Salary | "January Salary - Acme Corp" |
| Freelance | "Website Project - Client Name" |
| Refund | "Amazon Refund - Returned Item" |
| Interest | "FD Interest - SBI" |
| Gift | "Birthday Gift - From Parents" |

## Recording Transfers

### When to Use Transfers

Use transfers for money moving between YOUR accounts:
- ATM withdrawal (bank → cash)
- Credit card payment (bank → credit card)
- Savings contribution (checking → savings)
- Investment (bank → investment account)

### Step-by-Step

1. Navigate to Transfers
2. Click "Add Transfer" or "Record Transfer"
3. Fill in:
   - **Description**: Why you're transferring
   - **Amount**: How much
   - **Date**: When
   - **From Account**: Money source (debtor)
   - **To Account**: Money destination (creditor)
   - **Tags**: Optional categories
4. Save the transfer

### Common Transfer Scenarios

| Scenario | From | To |
|----------|------|-----|
| ATM withdrawal | Bank account | Cash |
| Credit card payment | Bank account | Credit card |
| Monthly savings | Salary account | Savings account |
| Invest in SIP | Bank account | Investment account |

## Using Tags Effectively

### Create a Tag System

Develop categories that work for you:

**Basic categories:**
- Food, Transport, Bills, Shopping, Entertainment, Health

**More detailed:**
- Food-Groceries, Food-Restaurant, Food-Snacks
- Transport-Uber, Transport-Fuel, Transport-Public

### Apply Tags Consistently

Always use the same tag for similar expenses:
- All grocery shopping → "Groceries" tag
- All Uber rides → "Transport" tag
- All Netflix/Spotify → "Subscription" tag

### Multi-Tag When Helpful

A transaction can have multiple tags:
- Business lunch → "Food" + "Work"
- Gift for friend → "Shopping" + "Gifts"

## Tracking People (Family Tracking)

### Why Track by Person

If multiple family members share finances:
- See individual spending
- Track who bought what
- Fair budget discussions

### How to Track

When recording a transaction:
1. Select the person who made it
2. Be consistent about assigning people
3. Leave blank for truly shared expenses

## Daily Workflow Example

### Morning

- Record any morning purchases (coffee, breakfast)
- Check if any automatic payments occurred (subscriptions)

### During the Day

- Record expenses as they happen
- Or keep receipts/mental notes

### Evening

- Review the day's transactions
- Record anything missed
- Quick check against bank app notifications

### Weekly

- Review the week's transactions
- Check for missing items
- Look for any errors

## Tips for Accuracy

### Match with Bank Statements

Periodically verify:
1. Open your bank app
2. Check recent transactions
3. Ensure all are recorded in Arthalekha
4. Add any missing ones

### Handle Small Expenses

Don't skip small purchases:
- ₹20 snack adds up over time
- Small expenses reveal spending patterns
- Round numbers are fine for tiny amounts

### Deal with Shared Expenses

When you pay for others:
- Record full amount as your expense
- Note in description: "Dinner - paid for team"
- Or split and record only your share

### Handle Reimbursements

When you get reimbursed:
- Original payment: Record as expense
- Reimbursement: Record as income
- Link them with similar descriptions

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Wrong Transaction Type

| Scenario | Wrong | Right |
|----------|-------|-------|
| ATM withdrawal | Expense | Transfer |
| Credit card payment | Expense | Transfer |
| Salary received | Transfer | Income |
| Paid for groceries | Transfer | Expense |

### Forgetting Regular Small Expenses

Track these easy-to-forget items:
- Daily coffee/tea
- Parking fees
- Tips
- Small snacks
- Auto/taxi rides

### Inconsistent Descriptions

Use similar descriptions for similar items:
- Don't use "Uber" sometimes and "Cab" other times
- Pick one style and stick with it

## Building the Habit

### Start Small

Week 1: Just record major expenses
Week 2: Add all expenses
Week 3: Add tags consistently
Week 4: Full tracking including transfers

Set a daily reminder to record transactions:
