# Filtering and Search

Arthalekha provides powerful **filtering and search** capabilities to help you find specific transactions and analyze your financial data. These tools work across incomes, expenses, and transfers.

## Overview

Filtering lets you narrow down transaction lists based on:
- Date ranges
- Accounts
- People
- Tags
- Text search

Combined filters help you answer questions like:
- "How much did I spend on food last month?"
- "What did Mom spend in January?"
- "All rent payments this year"

## Available Filters

### Date Range Filter

Filter transactions by time period:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **From Date** | Show transactions on or after this date |
| **To Date** | Show transactions on or before this date |

**Common uses:**
- This month's transactions
- Last quarter's spending
- Year-to-date income

### Account Filter

Show transactions for a specific account:
- Filter expenses from your credit card
- View income to your salary account
- Check transfers involving savings

### Person Filter

Show transactions for a specific person:
- View Dad's expenses only
- Check Mom's income
- Compare individual spending

### Tag Filter

Show transactions with a specific tag:
- All "Food" expenses
- All "Salary" income
- All "Subscription" payments

### Text Search

Search within transaction descriptions:
- Search for "Netflix" to find subscription
- Search for "grocery" to find shopping trips
- Search for vendor names

## Using Filters

### Basic Filtering

1. Go to the list view (Incomes, Expenses, or Transfers)
2. Look for filter controls at the top
3. Select your filter criteria
4. The list updates automatically

### Combining Filters

Filters work together (AND logic):
- Date range + Account = Transactions from that account in that period
- Person + Tag = Transactions by that person in that category
- All filters combined = Very specific results

### Default Filters

By default, lists typically show:
- Current month's transactions
- All accounts
- All people
- All tags

You can change these to view different data.

## Filter Combinations for Analysis

### Monthly Category Spending

To see how much you spent on food last month:
1. Set date range to last month
2. Filter by tag: "Food"
3. View total at bottom (or calculate from list)

### Person's Monthly Activity

To see what a family member spent:
1. Set date range to desired month
2. Filter by person
3. See all their transactions

### Account Activity Over Time

To see all activity on an account:
1. Filter by account
2. Set date range to desired period
3. Review all transactions

### Specific Vendor or Service

To find all payments to a specific vendor:
1. Use text search with vendor name
2. Optionally filter by date range
3. See all matching transactions

## Search Tips

### Effective Searching

For best results:
- Use keywords from descriptions
- Try partial words (e.g., "Netf" for Netflix)
- Search is case-insensitive

### What's Searched

Search looks in:
- Transaction descriptions

### Search Examples

| Search Term | Finds |
|-------------|-------|
| "Netflix" | Netflix subscription payments |
| "grocery" | Grocery shopping transactions |
| "HDFC" | Any transaction mentioning HDFC |
| "dinner" | Dinner outings |

## Filter Persistence
