# People

**People** in Arthalekha represent the members of your household, family, or group. Associating transactions with people helps you understand individual financial patterns within a shared financial ecosystem.

## What is a Person?

A Person is an individual whose financial activity you want to track separately. This is particularly useful for:

- Families tracking individual spending
- Couples managing joint finances
- Roommates sharing expenses
- Small groups with shared accounts

## Person Properties

Each person record contains:

| Property | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Name** | Yes | The person's full name |
| **Nickname** | No | A short name or alias |

## Why Track People?

### Family Budgeting

When multiple family members share accounts, tracking people helps answer:
- Who is spending the most?
- What is each person spending on?
- How much income does each person contribute?

### Individual Accountability

Even with shared finances, people can see their own:
- Total spending for the month
- Spending by category
- Income contributions

### Fair Distribution

Understanding individual spending helps with:
- Splitting shared expenses fairly
- Identifying spending imbalances
- Having informed budget discussions

## Using People with Transactions

### With Incomes

Associate an income with a person to track who earned it:
- Dad's salary
- Mom's freelance income
- Child's part-time job earnings

### With Expenses

Associate an expense with a person to track who spent it:
- Who made that grocery purchase?
- Whose subscription is this?
- Who paid for the dinner?

### With Transfers

Transfers are typically not associated with people since they're internal account movements. However, the accounts involved might belong to different people.

## Creating People

When creating a person, provide:

### Name
The full name for the person:
- "Rahul Sharma"
- "Priya Patel"
- "Mom"
- "Dad"

### Nickname (Optional)
A shorter name for quick identification:
- "Rahul" → Nickname: "R"
- "Priya Patel" → Nickname: "Priya"
- Can be left blank if not needed

## People in the Interface

When recording transactions, you'll see a dropdown to select the person. The display shows:
- Full name
- Nickname in parentheses (if provided)

Example: "Rahul Sharma (R)" or "Priya Patel (Priya)"

## Filtering by Person

You can filter transactions to see only those for a specific person:

1. Go to Incomes, Expenses, or the relevant list
2. Use the "Person" filter dropdown
3. Select the person you want to view
4. The list shows only their transactions

This is powerful for:
- Monthly spending reviews by person
- Understanding individual patterns
- Preparing individual reports

## Best Practices

### Keep It Simple

Only create people you actually need to track:
- For a couple: Just two people
- For a family: Each member who has independent transactions
- Don't create people for one-off situations

### Consistent Usage

Always associate transactions with the correct person:
- Make it a habit when recording transactions
- Review periodically for consistency
- Update old transactions if needed

### Use Nicknames Wisely

Nicknames help when:
- Full names are long
- You want quick identification
- Multiple people share similar names

### Person vs Account

Don't confuse people with accounts:

| Concept | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Person** | WHO made/received a transaction |
| **Account** | WHERE the money is stored |

One person can use multiple accounts, and one account can be used by multiple people.

## Example Setup

### Family of Four

| Name | Nickname |
|------|----------|
| Rajesh Kumar | Dad |
| Sunita Kumar | Mom |
| Arjun Kumar | Arjun |
| Ananya Kumar | Ananya |

### Couple

| Name | Nickname |
|------|----------|
| Amit Sharma | Amit |
| Neha Sharma | Neha |

### Roommates

| Name | Nickname |
|------|----------|
| Vikram Singh | Vik |
| Rohit Verma | Rohit |
| Karan Malhotra | Karan |

## Reporting by Person

With people set up and transactions associated, you can:

1. **Filter incomes by person** - See each person's earnings
2. **Filter expenses by person** - See each person's spending
3. **Export filtered data** - Create individual reports
4. **Compare across people** - Understand household distribution

## When Not to Use People

People tracking is optional. You might skip it if:
- You're the only user
- You don't need individual breakdowns
- Transactions are truly shared/joint

In these cases, simply leave the Person field blank when recording transactions.
