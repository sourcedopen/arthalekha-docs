# Incomes

An **Income** in Arthalekha represents money received into one of your accounts. Recording incomes helps you track where your money comes from and maintain accurate account balances.

## What is an Income?

An income is any money that comes into your possession and increases an account balance. Common examples include:

- Salary or wages
- Freelance payments
- Investment returns (dividends, interest)
- Refunds
- Cash gifts received
- Rental income
- Sales of items

## Income Properties

Each income record contains:

| Property | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Description** | Yes | What the income is for (e.g., "January Salary") |
| **Amount** | Yes | The amount received |
| **Date** | Yes | When the income was received |
| **Account** | Yes | Which account received the money |
| **Person** | No | Who received this income (optional) |
| **Tags** | No | Categories/labels for this income |

## How Incomes Affect Balances

When you record an income:

1. The **account's current balance increases** by the income amount
2. The **monthly balance record** is updated for the transaction month
3. Any **projected balances** are recalculated

This happens automatically - you just need to record the income.

### Example

If your "HDFC Savings" account has a balance of ₹50,000 and you record a salary income of ₹75,000:

```
Before: ₹50,000
Income: +₹75,000
After:  ₹1,25,000
```

## Recording an Income

When recording an income, you'll need to provide:

### 1. Description
A clear description of what the income is for:
- "January 2024 Salary"
- "Freelance - Website Project"
- "Amazon Refund"
- "Birthday Gift from Dad"

### 2. Amount
The exact amount received. Enter the amount that was actually credited to your account (after any deductions).

### 3. Date and Time
When the income was received. This is important for:
- Accurate balance calculations
- Monthly reports
- Historical tracking

### 4. Account
Select which account received the money. The balance of this account will increase.

### 5. Person (Optional)
If tracking income by family member, select who received this income:
- "Dad" for father's salary
- "Mom" for mother's business income
- Leave blank if not tracking by person

### 6. Tags (Optional)
Add tags to categorize the income:
- "Salary" for regular employment income
- "Passive" for investment returns
- "Refund" for returned money

## Filtering and Searching Incomes

You can filter your income list by:

| Filter | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Date Range** | View incomes within a specific period |
| **Account** | View incomes for a specific account |
| **Person** | View incomes received by a specific person |
| **Tag** | View incomes with a specific tag |
| **Search** | Search in income descriptions |

## Exporting Incomes

You can export your filtered income list to CSV format for:
- Backup purposes
- Analysis in spreadsheet software
- Tax preparation
- Sharing with family members

## Income vs Transfer

It's important to understand the difference:

| Scenario | Record as |
|----------|-----------|
| Received salary from employer | **Income** |
| Received payment for services | **Income** |
| Moved money from Account A to Account B | **Transfer** (not income) |
| Withdrew cash from bank to wallet | **Transfer** (not income) |
| Received gift/cash from outside | **Income** |

**Rule of thumb**: If money is entering your financial ecosystem from outside, it's an income. If money is just moving between your accounts, it's a transfer.

## Best Practices

### Be Specific with Descriptions
Instead of just "Salary", use "January 2024 Salary" or "Acme Corp - Jan Salary". This makes searching and reviewing easier.

### Record Promptly
Record incomes as soon as they're received. This keeps your balances accurate and reduces the chance of forgetting transactions.

### Use Tags Consistently
Develop a consistent tagging system:
- "Salary" for all employment income
- "Business" for business/freelance income
- "Investment" for returns, dividends, interest
- "Other" for miscellaneous income

### Associate with People
If multiple family members earn income, always associate incomes with the correct person. This enables:
- Individual income tracking
- Per-person reports
- Understanding household income distribution
