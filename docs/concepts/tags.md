# Tags

**Tags** in Arthalekha provide a flexible way to categorize and organize your transactions. Unlike rigid category systems, tags let you create whatever organizational structure makes sense for you.

## What are Tags?

Tags are labels you can attach to transactions (incomes, expenses, and transfers). They help you:

- Categorize transactions by type
- Group related transactions together
- Filter and analyze spending patterns
- Create custom organizational systems

## Why Use Tags?

### Flexible Categorization

Traditional expense trackers force you into predefined categories. Tags let you create your own:
- "Food" for all food-related expenses
- "Work" for business-related transactions
- "Vacation-2024" for a specific trip
- Any combination that works for you

### Multiple Categories

A single transaction can have multiple tags:
- A business lunch could be tagged: "Food", "Work", "Client Meeting"
- A gift could be tagged: "Shopping", "Birthday", "For-Mom"

### Easy Analysis

Filter by any tag to see:
- Total spent on "Food" this month
- All "Subscription" expenses
- "Emergency" expenditures over time

## Creating Tags

Tags are simple - they just have a name:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Name** | A descriptive label (e.g., "Food", "Transport", "Bills") |

### Tag Naming Tips

- Keep names short but descriptive
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Consider using prefixes for grouping: "Bill-Electric", "Bill-Water"

## Using Tags with Transactions

### Adding Tags

When creating or editing a transaction:
1. Find the Tags field
2. Select one or more tags from the list
3. Tags are immediately associated with the transaction

### Viewing Tagged Transactions

Tags appear on transaction listings, making it easy to see how each transaction is categorized.

### Filtering by Tag

Use the Tag filter to view only transactions with a specific tag:
1. Go to Incomes, Expenses, or Transfers list
2. Select a tag from the filter dropdown
3. View all transactions with that tag

## Suggested Tag Systems

### By Category (Most Common)

```
Food
Transport
Bills
Entertainment
Shopping
Health
Education
Home
Personal
```

### By Necessity

```
Essential
Important
Optional
Luxury
```

### By Frequency

```
Daily
Weekly
Monthly
Yearly
One-time
```

### By Project or Goal

```
Home-Renovation
Vacation-Goa
Wedding
Emergency
Investment
```

### Combined Approach

You can use tags from multiple systems on the same transaction:

| Transaction | Tags |
|-------------|------|
| Electricity bill | Bills, Essential, Monthly |
| Movie tickets | Entertainment, Optional, Weekly |
| Vacation hotel | Vacation-Goa, Travel, One-time |

## Tags for Different Transaction Types

### Income Tags

Common income tags:
- Salary
- Freelance
- Investment
- Refund
- Gift
- Rental

### Expense Tags

Common expense tags:
- Food
- Transport
- Bills
- Shopping
- Entertainment
- Health
- Education

### Transfer Tags

Common transfer tags:
- Savings
- Investment
- Card-Payment
- Emergency-Fund

## Best Practices

### Start Simple

Begin with a few broad categories:
- Food, Transport, Bills, Shopping, Other
- Add more specific tags as needed

### Be Consistent

Use the same tag for similar transactions:
- Always use "Food" not sometimes "Food" and sometimes "Groceries"
- Create separate tags if you need to distinguish (e.g., "Food-Groceries", "Food-Restaurant")

### Review Periodically

- Check if your tags still make sense
- Merge similar tags if they're redundant
- Add new tags for new spending patterns

### Don't Over-Tag

Not every transaction needs multiple tags:
- One or two relevant tags is usually enough
- Too many tags makes analysis confusing

### Use Tags for Goals

Create tags for financial goals:
- "Save-For-Car" on relevant savings transfers
- "Reduce-This" on expenses you want to minimize
- "Track-Carefully" on variable expenses

## Analyzing with Tags

### Monthly Tag Summary

Filter by tag and date range to see:
- Total food expenses this month
- Entertainment spending trends
- Bill totals over time

### Tag Comparisons

Compare spending across tags:
- Food vs Entertainment
- Essential vs Optional
- This month vs last month

### Exporting Tagged Data

Export filtered data to CSV for deeper analysis:
1. Filter by the desired tag
2. Export to CSV
3. Analyze in your preferred spreadsheet tool

## Tags vs People

Both tags and people help organize transactions, but they serve different purposes:

| Feature | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Tags** | WHAT type of transaction | "Food", "Entertainment" |
| **People** | WHO made the transaction | "Dad", "Mom" |

You can use both together: An expense tagged "Food" made by "Mom".

## Managing Tags

### Creating New Tags

Create tags as you need them:
1. Go to Tags section
2. Create a new tag with a descriptive name
3. Use it immediately on transactions

### Editing Tags

Change a tag name to update it across all transactions:
1. Edit the tag
2. Change the name
3. All transactions with that tag are updated

### Deleting Tags

Remove tags you no longer need:
1. Delete the tag
2. It's removed from all transactions
3. The transactions themselves remain unchanged
